# Awesome Scientific MCP


> A curated list of awesome MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers designed for scientific discovery.

This project aims to provide a foundational ecosystem of MCP for building "AI Scientist" systems capable of autonomous scientific discovery.

## Motivation

We are in an era of AI for Science. Building AI systems capable of autonomous scientific exploration is key to the next scientific revolution. As argued in the paper *Autonomous Scientific Discovery Through Hierarchical AI Scientist Systems*, a rich ecosystem of specialized, composable MCP servers is a necessary cornerstone for creating hierarchical, autonomous "AI Scientists". These servers act as standardized digital lab equipment, empowering AI agents to perform complex scientific tasks.

However, efficiently expanding this ecosystem is a challenge. To address this, the research in *Code2MCP: Automatically Convert GitHub Repository to MCP Server* explores methods to automatically convert the vast number of existing scientific code repositories into standardized MCP services. This dramatically lowers the barrier for researchers to contribute their tools, making it possible to integrate valuable scientific code into AI workflows.

## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.

Using MCP, AI applications like Claude Code or Cursor can connect to data sources (e.g. local files, databases), tools (e.g. search engines, calculators) and workflows (e.g. specialized prompts)â€”enabling them to access key information and perform tasks.

Think of MCP like a **USB-C port for AI applications**. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect electronic devices, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to external systems.

## How to Use an MCP Server

You can integrate MCP servers into AI-powered development environments to extend their capabilities. The `[mcp]` address is the installable endpoint for the tool.

### In Claude Code
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp

MCP servers can be configured in three different ways depending on your needs:

Option 1: Add a remote SSE server:
SSE (Server-Sent Events) servers provide real-time streaming connections. Many cloud services use this for live updates.

```
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Linear
claude mcp add --transport sse linear https://mcp.linear.app/sse

# Example with authentication header
claude mcp add --transport sse private-api https://api.company.com/mcp \
  --header "X-API-Key: your-key-here"
```

Option 2: Add a remote HTTP server
HTTP servers use standard request/response patterns. Most REST APIs and web services use this transport.

```
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport http <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Notion
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp

# Example with Bearer token
claude mcp add --transport http secure-api https://api.example.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```
